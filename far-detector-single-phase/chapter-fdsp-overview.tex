\chapter{Overview of the Single-Phase Detector Module Design}
\label{ch:fdsp-ov}


\fixme{The numbers in this chapter come from ProtoDUNE-SP; fix them for DUNE}

The elements composing a single-phase detector module, listed in Section~\ref{intro:detector}, include the time projection chamber (TPC), the cold electronics (CE), and the photon detection system (PDS).  The TPC components, e.g., anode planes, cathode planes and the field cage, are designed in a modular way.  
The six APAs are arranged into two APA planes, each consisting of three side-by-side APAs. Between them,  
a central cathode plane, composed of 18 CPA modules, splits the TPC volume into two electron-drift regions, one on each side of the cathode plane. 
A field cage (FC) completely surrounds the four
open sides of the two drift regions to ensure that the electric field within is uniform and unaffected by the presence of the cryostat walls and other nearby conductive structures. 

Figure~\ref{fig:fc-overview} illustrates how these components fit together.

Table~\ref{tab:tpc-components} lists the principal detection elements of the single-phase detector module along with their approximate dimensions and their quantities.
